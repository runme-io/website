        <p>Runme is initiated by <a href="https://jexia.com" target="_blank">Jexia</a> in cooperation with <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank">Digital Ocean</a> to provide a new opportunity and experience to run an applications.</p>

        <p>As the name already explains: Runme makes it possible to build, deploy and launch an application with just one click. </p>

        <p>So you can have a running application in a few minutes without the need to setup any environment. You just need to "Runme" and test your running application. If needed you can share your running application with clients, friends or colleagues, or even visitors of your Git repo. The application will run for 10 minutes and be removed afterwards. </p>
